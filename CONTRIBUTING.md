You have two options to create an issue, [Bug Report](https://github.com/johnnolan/encounter-stats/issues/new?assignees=johnnolan&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) or [New Feature](https://github.com/johnnolan/encounter-stats/issues/new?assignees=johnnolan&labels=feature&template=feature_report.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D).

The module is built using Typescript and I have a lot of code quality tooling in place to stop me writing loads of bad code. If I pass things back because these things don't pass these standard, please understand this is not to cause any sort of offence. It is important to keep things as standardised and tested as possible.

Thank you for being awesome
