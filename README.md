# Encounter Statistics

### Current features are

* Works with standard roles, `midi-qol` and `dnd5e`
* Enemies must be targetted in order for kills to be registered
    * Multiple targets will show roll damage and roll damage x targets
* Uses the new V10 Journal
* Optional Simple Calendar Integration for nicer Journal Entry names

**Note: Due to time and life I will not be adding other systems except midi-qol**
