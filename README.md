# FVTT Encounter Stats

This module is designed to capture your 

- Players attacks
- Damage
- HP
- Round Damage
- Top stats
- Enemy data
- Healing
- Kills
- Support Actions
- Battlefield Actions

It also stores your `Natural 1s`, `Natural 20s`, `Kills` and `Heals` throughout your campaign currently split by day recorded. **Do not delete the 2 entries for this, you will lose your data!**

All this is stored in a Journal Entry with a summary of their stats for each after you end the Encounter. There is also a copy of the raw JSON data from each battle should you wish to do more analysis of the recorded data.

You have an option for AOE attacks to either use the dice roll damage or record the damage taken to creatures within the template area.

This can then be viewed post battle to look upon for the Players to analyse and celebrate their attacks and as a DM, give you a better idea of how to build your Encounters in the future.

The current module works on rolls from the following list.

* [Better Rolls for 5e](https://github.com/RedReign/FoundryVTT-BetterRolls5e)
* [Beyond20](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/beyond20/)
* [midi-qol](https://gitlab.com/tposney/midi-qol)
* [MARS 5e - Moerills alternative rolling style for 5e](https://github.com/Moerill/fvtt-mars-5e)
* Vanilla Foundry

If you would like to see another module supported that isn't above then feel free to add it as a feature to the issues list in Github.
