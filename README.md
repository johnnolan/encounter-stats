# Encounter Statistics

### Current features are

* Works with standard roles, `midi-qol` and `dnd5e`
* Enemies must be targetted in order for kills to be registered
    * Multiple targets will show roll damage and roll damage x targets
* Uses the new V10 Journal
* Optional Simple Calendar Integration for nicer Journal Entry names
* Can track multiple active combats at one time

#### Encounter Tracking

- Players attacks
- Damage
- HP
- Round Damage
- Top stats
- Healing
- Kills
- Support Actions
- Battlefield Actions

#### Campaign Stats

**Do not delete the 2 journal entries for this, you will lose your data!**

- Natural 1s
- Natural 20s
- Kills
- Heals


**Note: Due to time and life I will not be adding other systems except midi-qol**
