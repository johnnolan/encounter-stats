Eager to prove to her father that she was as capable as any of her brothers, she left The Jorus to make a name for herself.\nDuring her time in TKA, she proved herself to have quite the tactical mind and went on to become a strategic advisor to Knight Thyme of the Duke's Battalion where she still remains.\n\n\nHer appointment to advisor earned her an invitation to the secretive guild Order of The Scarlet Moon, a place where you can get almost anything you want as long as you have the gold for it. Lorena has been able to use her position in logistics to move everything from halfling prostitutes to the rare snowberries from The Upper Peaks, in and out of the city without arousing suspicions from The City Guard. It was a tip off from The Order that resulted in Lorena's watchful eye being drawn to two strangers in the area.</p>",

The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p><h1>Backstory</h1><p>House Aldabra has held the territory along the coast of The Jorus since they drove out the orcish tribes during The Battle of Black Jorus.\nOnce old Lord Caidan Aldabra had settled his people on the fertile land, they quickly became expert farmers and fishermen, famous across the lands for their dark skin and pale hair. \nLorena Aldabra, the youngest of four children and the only female to the current Lord and Lady Aldabra was a somewhat of a hoyden, preferring time wrestling and fishing with her brothers over that of the silly noble girls with their dress robes and silken slippers.\nWith noble females having no right to own land of their own, and refusing to marry Bryce Crawford, Lorena answered the call to arms for fighters with knowledge of the local land to join The King's Army. Eager to prove to her father that she was as capable as any of her brothers, she left The Jorus to make a name for herself.\nDuring her time in TKA, she proved herself to have quite the tactical mind and went on to become a strategic advisor to Knight Thyme of the Duke's Battalion where she still remains.\n\n\nHer appointment to advisor earned her an invitation to the secretive guild Order of The Scarlet Moon, a place where you can get almost anything you want as long as you have the gold for it. Lorena has been able to use her position in logistics to move everything from halfling prostitutes to the rare snowberries from The Upper Peaks, in and out of the city without arousing suspicions from The City Guard. It was a tip off from The Order that resulted in Lorena's watchful eye being drawn to two strangers in the area.</p>"
